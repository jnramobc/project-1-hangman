Your gameâ€™s name: Include a description of your game and what it does. Background info about the game and why you chose it is a nice touch.

my game is spaceman(hangman with a space theme) it allows the user to select letters in order to guess a secret word. i chose it because i've always like to play hangman and i knew i would be able to navigate the rules with javascript.

Getting started: Include a link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important. This should also contain a link to your planning materials.
Deployed project link: https://jnramobc.github.io/project-1-hangman/
planning materials link: https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEBR-0610/course-info/issues/15

instructions: Choose a Letter: Click on one of the letter buttons to make a guess.
Check the Word: If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct position(s).
Incorrect Guesses: Each wrong guess will bring the spaceman closer to being lost.
Youe have until the entire spaceman body appears (6 incorrect guesses) to guess the entire word. If you run out of turns, the spaceman is lost
Win or Lose: Successfully guess the word before your turns run out to save the spaceman and win the game. If not, brace yourself for an interstellar defeat.

Attributions: This section should include links to any external resources (such as libraries or assets) you used to develop your application that require attribution. You can exclude this section if it does not apply to your application.

Technologies used: List of the technologies used, for example: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.

id like to make it so the user can press a play again button, instead of refreshing the screen for new game play.
